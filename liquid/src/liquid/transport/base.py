"""Transport abstraction — one driver per wire protocol.

The :class:`~liquid.sync.fetcher.Fetcher` owns the cross-cutting concerns that
are the same for every protocol (caching, rate-limit accounting, telemetry,
evolution signals, pagination orchestration) and delegates the actual wire call
to a :class:`ProtocolDriver` selected by ``Endpoint.protocol``.

A driver's job is narrow: given a :class:`FetchContext` (a fully-prepared
request — params, headers, built auth, cursor), perform the call and return a
:class:`DriverResponse` with the *normalized* result — a status code, a header
mapping, and the extracted records. Drivers never raise on protocol-level error
statuses; they report them in the response and let the Fetcher map them to the
shared recovery exceptions. This keeps non-HTTP protocols first-class instead of
bolted onto an HTTP-shaped pipeline.
