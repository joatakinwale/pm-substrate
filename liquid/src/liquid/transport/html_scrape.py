"""HTML-grid transport driver — turn any list/detail website into records.

Where the HTTP driver expects a JSON body, this driver expects HTML and a
:class:`~liquid.transport._html.GridSchema` in ``Endpoint.transport_meta``. It
fetches the grid page, enumerates records, and — when fields live on each
record's own page — fans out the N+1 detail fetches through the shared httpx
client (so the SSRF guard, redirects and pool all still apply). The output is
the same protocol-agnostic ``list[dict]`` every other driver returns, so
mapping, query, ``to_tools`` and sync above it are entirely unchanged: a scraped
catalogue is indistinguishable from a JSON API once it reaches the Fetcher.

The schema is field-generic (see :mod:`liquid.transport._html`), so the driver
is modality-agnostic — news feed, product catalogue, job board all flow through
the same code. The only HTML-specific logic in Liquid lives here and in the
matching discovery strategy.

Requires the ``scrape`` extra (``pip install 'liquid-api[scrape]'``); BeautifulSoup
is imported lazily inside the parse path so the core stays dependency-free.
