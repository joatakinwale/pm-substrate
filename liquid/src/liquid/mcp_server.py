"""Open-source MCP server — expose a self-hosted Liquid engine to any agent.

Runs the Liquid engine **in-process** (no cloud, no HTTP proxy) and serves its
capabilities as MCP tools over stdio. Point your agent (Claude Desktop, Cursor,
…) at it and it can discover + connect to any API and fetch typed data locally.

Run::

    pip install 'liquid-api[mcp]'
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # or GEMINI_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
                                        # or OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1 (Ollama)
    liquid-mcp                          # or: python -m liquid.mcp_server

Adapters and credentials persist under ``~/.liquid`` (see LIQUID_HOME). Without
an LLM key the server still fetches through already-connected adapters; discovery
(``liquid_connect`` / ``liquid_discover``) needs a model.
