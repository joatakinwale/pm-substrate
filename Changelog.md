## 2026-06-02 — Codebase review and workspace/agent-state research kickoff

- Reviewed the pm-substrate architecture, validation framework, three-axis state-validation plan, state-failure taxonomy, agent-continuity ADRs, continuity/eval packages, workflow gates, event provenance, graph staleness helpers, and the existing external landscape research draft.
- Verified the codebase is a real substrate implementation rather than only thesis material: graph/events/registry/workflow/projections/profile/capability/continuity/eval packages compile and run against local Postgres.
- Installed dependencies, built the monorepo, started local Postgres, applied 16 migrations, seeded `tenant_dev`, and ran the full DB-backed suite: 43 test files and 320 tests passed.
- Noted review findings for the next work slice: clean-clone `pnpm test` fails until `pnpm build` creates package entry outputs; local tests skip most integration proof without `PM_DATABASE_URL`; continuity contradiction detection is intentionally simple and must evolve before it can prove robust authority-aware agent memory; the next decisive research step is paired baseline/substrate evals against stateful external benchmarks such as STATE-Bench.
- Started independent external verification of the workspace and agent-state problem space. Current source direction supports the substrate thesis: multi-agent failures are increasingly framed as coordination/state failures, memory benchmarks emphasize behavior under changing state, blackboard-style shared state is reappearing in LLM MAS research, and Palantir Ontology validates the enterprise shared-world-model pattern while leaving room for a lighter open/profile-driven substrate.

## 2026-06-02 — Local-lab paired evals and Arrowsmith bridge

- Added deterministic local-lab paired evals in `@pm/evals`: stale memory after source update, wrong source authority conflict, and invalid workflow step after plan mutation.
- Mapped the local-lab scenarios to STATE-Bench-style categories: `stateful`, `user_experience`, and `procedural_execution`, with separate memory-benchmark bridge labels for `knowledge_update`, `abstention`, and workflow rebase behavior.
- Added `db/migrations/0017_eval_events.sql` so `evals.eval_events` is created by the root migration runner instead of only package-local SQL.
- Added `pnpm evals:local-lab`, which emits paired baseline/substrate eval events and persists them when `PM_DATABASE_URL` is set.
- Ran the local-lab eval suite against Postgres after applying migration `0017`: 3 scenarios, 6 events, baseline failures 3, substrate failures 0, failure reduction 3, and 6 persisted `local_lab` eval rows.
- Added `research/local-lab-state-bench-arrowsmith_2026-06-02.md`, connecting the first local-lab eval categories to current peer-reviewed/venue-accepted memory-agent and MAS evaluation work.
